<!--

    This file is a template for writing meeting announcements each week. Copy
    this template into the `_posts` directory with a correct file name and edit
    the details as needed.

    NOTE: The file name should follow this naming convention:

        YYYY-MM-DD-w#-tldr-title.md

    Where YYYY is year, MM is month, DD is day, and XX is what week of the
    semester the announcement is for. The date MUST be formatted correctly since
    the site uses that as a timestamp for the post! USE LOWERCASE FILE NAMES
    THIS SHOULD BE THE POST RELEASE DATE, NOT THE EVENT DATE!

    Extra metadata info:

    layout: post-event

      This tells Jekyll to use the new post template with support for additional metadata

    date-start:
    date-end:

      Timestamp for the start/end of the event. Make sure it's proper form, Jekyll
      will make sure it gets turned into a human-readable date string. HH is 24-hour time.

    location:

      Text location

    Why don't we use the site global variables from the config you ask?
    Well, those are subject to change, so for historical reasons.
    Also, we get better metadata this way.

    Finally, REMOVE THIS ENTIRE COMMENT BLOCK.
    The first thing in the file NEEDS to be the "---" line
