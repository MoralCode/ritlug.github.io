Last May, Red Hat and the open source community honored two exceptional women, Avni Khatri and Jigyasa Grover for the “Women in Open Source” award. This week, the RIT Linux User’s Group (RITlug) looks into the history behind the role of women in open source and tech communities. We examine the invaluable and extraordinary accomplishments of pioneering women that changed the foundations of open source and are paving the way for future generations of women to do the same.
