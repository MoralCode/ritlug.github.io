This week we had Solomon Rubin, an RIT alum, and former RITlug President! In this talk, former-Mitre Solomon Rubin offered a brief look into how the federal government tackles these challenges on a daily basis including how itâ€™s evolving: how it contributes to and develops open-source, how it utilizes Innersource within and across individual agencies, and of course, how Gitlab sits at the middle of all of this.
