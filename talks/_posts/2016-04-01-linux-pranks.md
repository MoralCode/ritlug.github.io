In line with RITlug meeting on April Fools Day, this presentation discusses a
collection of fun programs, creative shell settings, and other system
mischief.

RITlug recommends exercising good judgement before putting these pranks live
in any environment. Some of these pranks can crash or damage systems and
should never, ever be done in a system with uptime requirements.
