Hey RITlug!

This week we'll be taking a look at open source tools on Linux for design and audio/visual use. 
We'll take a look at the development status of tools old and new for photography, audio and video production, photo editing, drawing, and 2D/3D animation.
If you've ever wondered how FOSS plays a part in the design world, come to this talk to find out!

In other news, elections are in! The results are as follows:

President: Jeffery Russell
Vice President: Tim Zabel
Secretary: Henry Keena
Treasurer: Nathaniel Larrimore
Project Coordinator: Christian Martin


Congratulations to everyone! 



See you all soon,

- Tim Zabel (Tjzabel)
