Hello LUGers! This week Kyri will be giving a talk on data privacy that she
describes as follows:

Data privacy is becoming an increasingly important topic as companies collect
more data on their customers and data breaches become more common. While data
privacy laws have been around for a long time, they have gotten a lot more
attention since the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, was passed in
the European Union in 2016. Since then, several states in the US have passed
their own privacy laws. What does this mean for companies and consumers? Which
states have the best protections? And should the US pass a national privacy
law?
