Hey RITlug!


This week we're covering the intriguing and relevant topic of personal infrastructure. You'll be getting a lightning talk from different members of Eboard on the networks and systems we rely on, built on Linux and powered by open source software. In-depth descriptions, useful tips, and best practice recommendations on all of your favorite parts are sure to follow. We're looking forward to it!


See you there,

RITLUG Eboard
