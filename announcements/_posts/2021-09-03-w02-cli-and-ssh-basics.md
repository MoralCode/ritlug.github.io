Hello RITLUGers! It's now week two and we have our first real talk of the year for you.
We will be going over command line and SSH basics. Everything you should need to use the CS servers with ease.
We will be meeting in our usual spot: GOL-2620, at our usual time: 4:30.

Additionally, we've created some forms for y'all to submit your ideas. If you have a suggestion for a talk you'd like to see,
please go to [suggest.ritlug.com](http://suggest.ritlug.com) and tell us about it. If you'd like to
do a talk yourself, please go to [present.ritlug.com](http://present.ritlug.com) and submit you idea so we can
get you slotted in.

I hope to see you all on Friday!
