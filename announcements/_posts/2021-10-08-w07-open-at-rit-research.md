Hello LUGers, this week Olivia Gallucci will be giving a presentation on work
she did with Open@RIT that she describes as follows:

> The presentation is on research for Open@RIT I did last semester. The goal of
> my research was to (1) document the history of open source projects and their
> outcomes, (2) show how faculty and students can build off of past research
> using the current work in Zotero (3) instruct students and faculty about how to
> make their projects open source, and how they can get help from Open@RIT. 
> 
> As a computing security student, I focus on open security, and how students can
> request help and or funding for projects through Open@RIT.

Hope to see you there!
