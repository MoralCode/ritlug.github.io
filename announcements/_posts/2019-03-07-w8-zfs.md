Hey RITluggers!

This week's talk is all about snapshots, self healing, and more block storage than you can believe! Why yes, it's ZFS!

Josh (that's me) will be going over the history and basics of ZFS. We'll go swimming in a zpool, and take some snapshots to remember it. :) Complete with a demo of some cool ZFS features!

ZFS may use a copy on write (COW) model, but there'll be no bull at this talk about an udderly fantastic filesystem.

Just bad puns. Obviously.

Check out the good points, and the pain points, in this week's PowerPoint. Then enjoy a nice, long spring break!
