Hey RITlug!

This week we're welcoming a wonderful alumni panel for a meeting about the intersection of Linux, Open Source, and our day jobs. We'll be hearing from RIT alumni Solomon Rubin, Mark Repka, Nate Levesque, and Josh Bicking about where work and Open Source Software meet. Swing by and check it out.

See you there,

RITLUG Eboard
