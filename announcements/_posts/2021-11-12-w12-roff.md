Hey LUGers,
This week I'll be talking about the boomers' TeX alternative: roff! With roff, and its pals tbl and eqn, you can typeset
surprisingly intricate formal documents that compile quickly without having to install any extra software. All you need
is a text editor and a pulse. You'll wonder how you ever did your homework without it.

See you this Friday!
