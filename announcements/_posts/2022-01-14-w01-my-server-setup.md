Hello LUGers!
Welcome to the first meeting of the semester. This week Ben will be showing you
how they configure their server.

We need talks! It's going to get boring if e-board are the only ones giving
talks all semester, so please sign up to give a talk if you're able.
http://present.ritlug.com/ Or if you have something you'd like us to talk about
please let us know, we are running out of ideas. http://suggest.ritlug.com/
