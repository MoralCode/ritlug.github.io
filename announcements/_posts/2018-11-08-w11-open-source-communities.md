After the news broke that IBM was purchasing Red Hat r/linux exploded with predictions about the end of Fedora and CentOS.
This week [Charles Profitt](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Cprofitt) will explain why, based on history, you should Stay Calm and Carry On.
Charles Profitt is an active member of the Fedora Project and is an IT administrator at a local school district.

Last year Charles Profitt gave a very interesting talk on open source infrastructure; I am looking forward to his talk this week.

Hope to see you all there,
