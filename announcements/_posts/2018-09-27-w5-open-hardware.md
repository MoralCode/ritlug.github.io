Hey RITluggers!

Welcome back for another week of Linux & open source!
This week's meeting is brought to you by our guest speaker, Dan Schneiderman.

Dan is the co-chair of Maker Faire Rochester, and the lead organizer for the first New York State Maker Summit.
He has also been an active member of the Free and Open Source community within Rochester for many years.
Currently, Dan is a K-12 University Center Senior Outreach Specialist within RIT.

This week, he will be talking about open hardware projects, and Raspberry Pis.

Hope to see you there!<br />
