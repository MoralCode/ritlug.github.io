Welcome to Week 3!
I hope everyone is having a great first couple weeks.

This week's meeting focuses on RITlug's projects.
Ever wanted to know what RITlug does outside of our weekly meetings, or are you unsure about which open source project to contribute to?
This presentation discusses club projects like _Teleirc_ and _TigerOS_, while also delving into the wider scope of open source, such as the _GNOME Project_.

Whether you've yet to find a project to contribute to, or you're an open source veteran, come on down to this week's meeting!

Hope to see you there!<br />
