Hello everyone,

This semester RITlug will be meeting Fridays from 4-6pm in the Large DB Lab (GOL-2650) on the second floor of Golisano Hall.
Our first meeting will be on September 7th (week 2).

Welcome to all of our new members, including those who came to visit us at the Tiger Activities Gala!
We had a good turnout, as well as some additional online signups, and hope to see you coming to our meetings.
RITlug is a student-led organization to promote and teach students about Linux & open source.
We work on projects and discuss interesting topics in the Linux & open source communities.
**The best way to communicate is in the Slack #general channel**, although for general open source discussion there's more activity in the #foss channel.

To returning members, we're trialing using CampusGroups for emails as RIT's spam filters have been getting increasingly strict.
If you're subscribed to the Google Groups mailing list, you might be getting two copies of this email.
This would be a good time to review your email settings if you don't want this.

See you all soon,<br />
