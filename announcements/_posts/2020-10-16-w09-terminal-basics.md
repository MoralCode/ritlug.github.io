Hey RITluggers,

Have no idea where to start with the Linux command line? 
Are you an absolute beginner in need of some advice on where to get started?
This week we have a talk on the absolute basics of the Linux command line, from navigating directories to command structures!

I hope you are all doing well this strange semester.
It is already week 9?!!
