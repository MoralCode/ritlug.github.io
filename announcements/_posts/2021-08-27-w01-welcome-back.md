Hello RITLUGers new and old. Welcome to week 1!
This Friday we will hold our first meeting of the semester in GOL-2620.

As this is our fist in person meeting in over a year, we're going to kick things off with a
more laid back, "getting to know everyone" style meeting. We want to hear from you, what do
you want out of your Linux User Group this year? Presentations? Projects? Bring your ideas if
you have them!
