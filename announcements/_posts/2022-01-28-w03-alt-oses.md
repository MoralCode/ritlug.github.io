Hello LUGers!

Welcome to Week 3! Today Bit will be doing a talk exploring esoteric or
alternative OS structure and some interesting ways of rethinking common
computing tropes.

We're still looking for your talks! You can share anything that you find
interesting related to what we do. Just fill in the form at
