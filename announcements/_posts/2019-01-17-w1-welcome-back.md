Hello RITlug and welcome to Week 1!
This Friday we will hold our first meeting of the semester in GOL-2650.

In true LUG form we will kick things off by trialing Linux distributions on the lab machines (or personal machines, we will have flash drives readily available for booting).

Come join us for a fun evening of exploring new distros and re-discovering old favorites!

Each month will consist of presentations from students and guest speakers that follow a theme.
