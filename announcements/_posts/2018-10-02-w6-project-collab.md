Hey RITluggers,

I hope you are all enjoying your classes and the wet Rochester weather.

To kick off the start of October/Hacktoberfest, we are having a project collaboration night this Friday.
This will be a casual meeting where we will work on projects and hang out.
This is a great time to find a project for Hacktoberfest and share your own projects.

Hope to see you all there!

-Jeffery Russell (jrtechs)
