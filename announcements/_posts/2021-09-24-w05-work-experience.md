Hello LUGers! At today's meeting we're going to be sharing experiences around
getting hired and having a job. Those with relevant work experience are
encouraged to share it with the group, and all are welcome to participate in
discussion. Additionally, several RITLUG alumni will be coming to today's
meeting to share their experience. I look forward to seeing you all today in
the usual place: GOL-2620, 4:30pm!
