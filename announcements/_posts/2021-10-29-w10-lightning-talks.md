Hello LUGers, as we announced earlier, we are doing lightning talks this week!
We will be doing a series of short 5-10 minute talks on anything Linux, FOSS,
or tech related. Or anything else you think would be of interest to the club.
You don't need to prepare slides or anything, just come up and talk! You could
show us your Linux setup, show off a CLI cool tool you use, show off a project
you've worked on, or even give us your spiciest tech hot takes. 

An additional announcement, HFOSS is being offered this coming spring semester.
More info below.

GCCIS now has an Immersion in Free Culture and Free and Open Source Computing
(https://www.rit.edu/study/free-culture-and-free-and-open-source-computing-immersion)
and one of the required courses, IGME-582, Humanitarian Free & Open Source
Software Development is offered next semester, M, W, F from 12:00-12:50. 

The course is also required for the Free and Open Source Software and Free
Culture Minor
(https://www.rit.edu/study/free-and-open-source-software-and-free-culture-minor). 

It’s also a gen ed course, for students who may need one in their worksheet
if they have an interest in the subject but not the immersion or minor.

Students can see a copy of last year’s syllabus
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NklzMMRhidi6xXSM-QahRMDDOekRmnC1iwykMtqHC7M/edit?usp=sharing),
this year’s course will be similar in structure, the speakers and some of the
assignments may vary slightly.

The course is open to students in all majors, the assignments run across the
roles of software projects and the assignments to contribute to projects can
include, but not be limited to, graphics, communications, interfaces and
more, in addition to software development.
