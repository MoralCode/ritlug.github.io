Hello LUGers! This week Ben will be giving a talk on Asynchronous I/O in Linux
and how it's needed for high performance networking. This talk will go over the
basics of systems programming and the kernel interfaces used. The talk will
mostly be on the whiteboard so you may want to sit closer to the front this
week. Hope to see you all there!
