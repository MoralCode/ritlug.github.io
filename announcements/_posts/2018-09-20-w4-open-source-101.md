Hello RITluggers,

I hope you all are enjoying week 4 as classes start to settle in.

Are you curious about open source?
What is it, really?
Is it GitHub?
Is it Linux?
In this session, learn what open source is all about and how you can even get involved.
You can get some resume boosters for yourself in the process too – no experience required!

You’ll never believe the two things nobody told you before about contributing to an open source project!

Hope to see you there!

-Jeffery Russell (jrtechs)
