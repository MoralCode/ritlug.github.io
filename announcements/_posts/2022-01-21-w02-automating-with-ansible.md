Hello LUGers!

Welcome to Week 2! Today we'll be doing a 101 on Ansible, an awesome automation tool that you can use to deploy anything.

We're still looking for your talks! You can share anything that you find interesting related to what we do. Just fill in the form at http://present.ritlug.com/ and tell us what you'd like to share.

You can also suggest talks that you'd like to hear more about here: http://suggest.ritlug.com/

See you there!
